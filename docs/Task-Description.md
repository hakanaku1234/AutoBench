# Task Description

## Task overview

### S Curve 
In this task, agents need to nevigate the the final target and go backward to the starting point.
I set to train on 10 agents for better efficiency

For easy training and testing, I seperate this task into forward and backward task, for different training complexity, the task also have the simple and detail version, details below. 

#### Simple Scene
Aim for easy and fast training. 
The scene will only have road, barrier, wall, all have relative simple geometry and texture.

The scene will have all props and detail texture for maximum reality.
